## 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

### Fixed Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
```typescript
// Key Fix: Dropzone Configuration
const { getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive } = useDropzone({
  accept: { 'image/*': ['.jpeg', '.jpg', '.png', '.gif'] },
  maxFiles: 5,
  onDrop: handleImageDrop,
  noKeyboard: true,        // Prevents keyboard conflicts
  preventDropOnDocument: true, // Isolates dropzone behavior
});
```
